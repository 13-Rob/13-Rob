title: Building a Jekyll site

I decided to build my own Jekyll site, to host my own site on GitHub pages. My decision
was based on two things: wanting to host the site on GitHub pages, and not wanting to use
a more complex framework for such a simple task. Through the process I discovered some
things that I wish I had seen on the very first Jekyll tutorial. That's what motivate me
to write a simple guide on how to build and deploy your own Jekyll site.
